Create a History Project using Impact.js. Use my existing framework to add a timeline that can be walked upon, as well as imagery and text boxes. What follows is a basic set of stories.


   * As a history teacher, I would like linetime to function as a completed history timeline, including all dates and imagery needed.




   * As a designer, I would like to enhance my learning by creating a video game to function as my history timeline. 




   * As a programmer, I would like linetime to be easily updatable.


   * As a player, I would like timeline to including limited gameplay potential beyond simple exploration, but I would like the gameplay experience to grow as the project continues. 


   * As a student, I would like linetime to be easily editable within the week that the timeline is assigned.
